  Son, she said, have I got a little story for you<br></br>
What you thought was your daddy was nothin' but a...<br></br>
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen<br></br>
Your real daddy was dyin', sorry you didn't see him,<br></br>
but I'm glad we talked...<br></br>

Oh I, oh, <b>I'm still alive</b><br></br>
Hey I, oh, <b>I'm still alive</b><br></br>
Hey I, oh, <b>I'm still alive</b><br></br>
Hey...oh...<br></br>

Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room<br></br>
She said I'm ready...for you<br></br>
I can't remember anything to this very day<br></br>
'Cept the look, the look...<br></br>
Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare...<br></br>

I, <b>I'm still alive</b><br></br>
Hey I, but, <b>I'm still alive</b><br></br>
Hey I, boy, <b>I'm still alive</b><br></br>
Hey I, I, I, <b>I'm still alive, yeah</b><br></br>
Ooh yeah...yeah yeah yeah...oh...oh...<br></br>

Is something wrong, she said<br></br>
Well of course there is<br></br>
You're still alive, she said<br></br>
Oh, and do I deserve to be<br></br>
Is that the question<br></br>
And if so...if so...who answers...who answers...<br></br>
I, oh, <b>I'm still alive</b><br></br>
Hey I, oh, <b>I'm still alive</b><br></br>
Hey I, but, <b>I'm still alive</b><br></br>
Yeah I, ooh, <b>I'm still alive</b><br></br>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah<br></br>
